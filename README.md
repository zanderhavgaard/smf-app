# SMF // Social Media Feed

Final hand-in for course Mobile App Development @ IT-University of Copnhagen.
By [@ThomasKeralla](https://github.com/thomaskeralla) [@ntudor11](https://github.com/ntudor11) & [@zanderhavgaard](https://github.com/zanderhavgaard)

Simple social media app, with feed for text and picture based posts that sync between users.
Sync is done in concurrently in the background and the feed will thus load in newer and older posts dynamically as they are needed in the user's view.
